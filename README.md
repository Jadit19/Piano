# Piano

## Background
- I like playing the Piano, and often indulge in it.
- The frequemcy of the different notes was obtained from <a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html">here</a>.

## Setup
My setup was on Ubuntu 20.04. To download SFML, run:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install libsfml-dev
```

Now, in order to run the application, navigate into this directory and run the following commands:
```sh
chmod +x ./run.sh
./run.sh
```
